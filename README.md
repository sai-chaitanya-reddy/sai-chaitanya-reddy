# End-to-End Machine Learning Project – Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow applied to a real-world fraud detection problem using highly imbalanced transaction data.  
The objective is to identify fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false positives.

This repository showcases practical skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, aligned with industry expectations for Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles.

## Problem Statement
Financial fraud causes significant losses to organizations.  
The challenge lies in detecting fraudulent transactions where fraud cases are rare and incorrect predictions have high business impact.
